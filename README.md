# GAT_prediction_based_on_time_windows
This project used time windows to create graphs and performed multi-step prediction with multiple inputs and multiple outputs via GAT. You can set output_dim to the number of features and seq_out_lens to the number of steps you want to predict. The dataset is private and not available.
